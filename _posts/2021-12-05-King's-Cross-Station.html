<p class="dropCap">King's Cross railway station, also known as London King's Cross, is a passenger railway terminus in the London Borough of Camden, on the edge of Central London <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station">[1]</a>. </p>
<p>In the Harry Potter films, King's Cross Station appears in every one of them, with Platform 9 and 3/4 (accessed through the brick wall barrier between platforms 9 and 10) being the wizards' entrance to Hogwarts.</p>

<p>In 《Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone》: </p> 
<p>00:33:02 - 00:36:01: The film is set in King's Cross station. This clip is about a funny incident that happened during Harry's first trip to Hogwarts. </p>

<p>In fact, the real location for the filming was not between platforms 9 and 10. This is because platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intermediate tracks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090205041223/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4504_King%27s%20Cross%20Station%20Map.pdf">[2]</a>. The real pick-up point is located between platforms 4 and 5 <a href="https://www.the-magician.co.uk/harry-potter-london-locations.htm">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1999, a replica of the 9 and 3/4 station plaque was erected on the platform with the half-entered suitcase underneath, and in 2012, the Harry Potter shop was opened and the plaque was relocated, making it a popular attraction for fans and tourists alike.</p>
