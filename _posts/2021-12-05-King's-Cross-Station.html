<p>In fact, the real location for the filming was not between platforms 9 and 10. This is because platforms 9 and 10 are in a separate building from the main station and are separated by two intermediate tracks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090205041223/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4504_King%27s%20Cross%20Station%20Map.pdf">[2]</a>. The real pick-up point is located between platforms 4 and 5 <a href="https://www.the-magician.co.uk/harry-potter-london-locations.htm">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1999, a replica of the 9 and 3/4 station plaque was erected on the platform with the half-entered suitcase underneath, and in 2012, the Harry Potter shop was opened and the plaque was relocated, making it a popular attraction for fans and tourists alike.</p>
