<p class="dropCap">The very well-known Harry Potter filming location is the stairwell leading to the hall <a href=" https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Staircase">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>These iconic Harry Potter scenes have been used in many movies, but they are best known for the grand arrival of the students on the first day of Hogwarts. In "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)">[2]</a>, Professor McGonagall stands at the top of the stairs and taps his fingers, waiting for the new students to enter.</p>

<p>Before leading them into the huge hall, she briefly introduced them to the sorting ceremony. Including the scene where Harry Potter saw his father's trophy in the corridor.</p>

<p>This is also the staircase that Harry and Ron climbed up when they arrived at Hogwarts in Arthur Weasley's flying car in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets">[3]</a>. They were rushing to attend the welcome banquet on time, but unfortunately, they were quickly caught by Mr. Filch.</p>
