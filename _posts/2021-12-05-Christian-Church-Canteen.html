<p>In this restaurant, the protagonists such as Harry, Ron, Hermione and others attend freshman entrance dinners, "sorting" ceremonies, Christmas dinners, student dances, etc. During meals on weekdays, they secretly discuss "special plans" to deal with their opponents. The prototype of this restaurant is the Oxford University Christian College Canteen, also known as the "Great Hall". The Harry Potter restaurant Oxford scenes were actually filmed at Leavesden Studios, where they rebuilt the hall, drawing inspiration from all the portraits and long tables.</p>

<p>Founded in 1525, Christian College is the largest college in Oxford University and the only church-style college in the world <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">[2]</a>. Its student cafeteria is an important part of the college. The cafeteria serves four meals a day, breakfast, lunch and two dinners. Among them, the dinner at 6 in the afternoon is informal, students and teachers can eat in casual clothes; the dinner at 8 in the evening is a formal dinner, and diners must wear formal attire.</p>

<p>The seats in the canteen are divided by level. For example, professors, senior researchers, and visiting researchers can sit at the "high table", while students can sit in ordinary seats. This classification began with the founder of the college. Because the founder was a bishop, the college was once called the "Bishop's College", so the religious hierarchy was maintained in many places.</p>

<p>British philosopher Locke, scientist Einstein, author of "Alice in Wonderland" Carol, and many British prime ministers and parliamentarians have all eaten in the cafeteria of Christian College <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">[3]</a>.</p>
